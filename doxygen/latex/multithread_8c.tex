This function call openMP and create all threads, and share the work. At the end, this function gather all datas and says if this is a prime number. 


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
\item[{\em p\_\-structCommon}]: all parameters of the program, number of threads to start \end{DoxyParams}


number of threads working in the program

current thread

seconds needed to check one mersenne number

for the waiting function, in order to free the CPU during a long computation

Used by keyboard handler, to check and do things

May be not used -\/-\/ Begin of the computation

May be not used -\/-\/ End of the computation
