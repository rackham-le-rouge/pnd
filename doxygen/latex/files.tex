Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{compute_8h}{compute.\-h} \\*All computing functions of the program  Computation functions, the brain of the program }{\pageref{compute_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bfseries conf.\-h} }{\pageref{conf_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{drawing_8c}{drawing.\-c} \\*All screen drawing functions  Here it is all of the drawing functions, including the splash and the help message. All ncurses stuff is here too }{\pageref{drawing_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{drawing_8h}{drawing.\-h} \\*All screen drawing functions prototypes  All is in the brief }{\pageref{drawing_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{main_8c}{main.\-c} \\*Main part of the program  There is the main function (start the screen and display the splash) and after run the program }{\pageref{main_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{main_8h}{main.\-h} \\*Call all functions of the rest of the program  All main functions of the program like deamon, exit point, entry point, default value settings and user menu }{\pageref{main_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{multithread_8c}{multithread.\-c} \\*Start / Stop / Manage all threads of this program  Here it is all of the stuff to have many threads. We choose to have a thread per number. Here, we start our thread and we stop them }{\pageref{multithread_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{multithread_8h}{multithread.\-h} \\*Declare functions of \hyperlink{multithread_8c}{multithread.\-c} and import other functions used in this source code  Control the multithread part of the program, share the work between all threads, start them, wait them all and gather informations }{\pageref{multithread_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{signalmanagement_8c}{signalmanagement.\-c} \\*Signal handling  In order to handle all signals of this program }{\pageref{signalmanagement_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{signalmanagement_8h}{signalmanagement.\-h} \\*Declare functions of \hyperlink{signalmanagement_8c}{signalmanagement.\-c} and import other functions used in this source code  In order to catch and act just after signal sending. So, we can have the time to save parameter just before kill }{\pageref{signalmanagement_8h}}{}
